  <h2>Explore Molecular Genetics</h2>
  <p>
   The Central Dogma Explorer refers to a structured way of understanding and visualizing the classical flow of genetic information in living systems. It builds on well-established principles while supporting modern learning needs.

Core Concept
Genetic information flows in a unidirectional manner:
DNA → RNA → Protein

Key Modules

Replication (DNA → DNA)
Accurate duplication of genetic material before cell division, ensuring continuity of life.

Transcription (DNA → RNA)
Synthesis of RNA (mRNA, tRNA, rRNA) from a DNA template, mediated by RNA polymerase.

Translation (RNA → Protein)
Decoding of mRNA at the ribosome to synthesize polypeptides using tRNA and amino acids.

Extended Insights

Exceptions and extensions: reverse transcription (RNA → DNA), RNA editing, and regulatory RNAs.

Regulation at transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and translational levels.

Purpose
A Central Dogma Explorer is typically used as an educational or interactive framework to:

Strengthen conceptual clarity for exams and coursework

Visually connect molecular processes

Bridge classical molecular biology with modern biotechnology applications
